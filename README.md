##  Interpretation and Exploration

- 'spiketriggeredavg': This MATLAB code is part of a project focused on investigating the encoding process of the H1 motion-sensitive neuron in the fly, specifically the Calliphora vicina species. The objective is to compute the spike-triggered average of the neuron's response to a motion stimulus represented by a stimulus vector (rho) and to determine the relevant features within the stimulus. The provided code initializes the necessary parameters, extracts time windows preceding each spike, and calculates the spike-triggered average. Additionally, it plots the resulting average for visual analysis. The code adheres to good programming practices by modularizing the functionality into a function (spiketriggeredavg) with well-defined inputs and outputs. The script demonstrates proficiency in handling neurophysiological data and leverages MATLAB's vectorized operations for efficiency in spike-triggered average computation.
